## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### Running the analysis

1. Update the `DATA_PATH` variable in `delivery_analysis.py` (or set it in a notebook) to point to your dataset:

```python
# Example: update the DATA_PATH variable with your dataset location
DATA_PATH = '/content/Food_Delivery_Times.csv'
```

2. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python delivery_analysis.py
```

### Expected Output

* 6 professional visualizations for delivery optimization
* Comprehensive business insights with actionable recommendations
* Cleaned dataset ready for further analysis (`optimized_delivery_data.csv`)
* Performance metrics and suggested optimization strategies

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

Each visualization is created to help identify operational bottlenecks and opportunities.

* **Delivery Time Distribution** — Histogram with an average time marker to show the overall spread and outliers.
* **Distance vs Delivery Time** — Scatter plot highlighting correlation between distance and delivery duration.
* **Delivery Performance Segments** — Bar chart grouping deliveries into time categories (e.g., on-time, delayed).
* **Time-of-Day Patterns** — Peak-hour analysis to find busiest delivery windows.
* **Order Value Impact** — Analysis of price vs delivery time to see whether order value affects speed.
* **Delivery Efficiency** — Distribution of km/minute efficiency to identify top/bottom performers.

## 💼 Business Impact

### Quantified Benefits (example outcomes)

* **15%** increase in customer retention with 5-minute faster deliveries.
* **20%** reduction in operational costs through peak-hour optimization.
* **25%** improvement in order frequency with improved on-time rates.

### Strategic Recommendations

* **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust pricing during peak hours to manage demand and incentivize off-peak orders.
* **Micro-fulfillment Centers**: Place small fulfillment hubs in high-density zones to cut travel time.
* **Delivery Time Guarantees**: Offer premium customers guaranteed delivery windows for a fee.
* **Route Optimization**: Implement routing heuristics or integrate route-optimization APIs for distances beyond 5 km.
