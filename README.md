## 📊 Project Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project that uncovers optimization opportunities in food delivery operations by analyzing delivery time patterns, distance impact, and operational efficiency metrics. This project provides actionable insights to improve delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Food delivery companies face challenges in maintaining consistent delivery times while managing operational costs. This analysis addresses:
- **Delivery time optimization** across different time slots and distances
- **Operational efficiency** improvements for fleet management
- **Customer experience** enhancement through faster deliveries
- **Cost reduction** through strategic resource allocation

## 📈 Key Insights

### 🚀 Performance Metrics
- **Average Delivery Time**: 35.2 minutes
- **On-Time Rate (<30min)**: 42.8%
- **Optimal Delivery Radius**: 0-2 km (fastest delivery times)
- **Peak Hour Impact**: Dinner hours show 40% longer delivery times

### 💡 Optimization Opportunities
1. **Only 28% of deliveries are "Fast" (<25 minutes)** - Significant improvement potential
2. **Dinner peak hours require 40% more delivery resources** - Fleet optimization needed
3. **Deliveries beyond 5km take 50% longer** - Strategic zone planning recommended

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: [Food Delivery Time Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction)
- **Enhanced Features**: Simulated distance, order value, and time patterns for comprehensive analysis

### Analysis Performed
1. **Delivery Time Distribution Analysis**
2. **Distance vs Delivery Time Correlation**
3. **Time-of-Day Pattern Recognition**
4. **Operational Efficiency Metrics**
5. **Business Impact Quantification**

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### Running the analysis

1. Update the `DATA_PATH` variable in `delivery_analysis.py` (or set it in a notebook) to point to your dataset:

```python
# Example: update the DATA_PATH variable with your dataset location
DATA_PATH = '/content/Food_Delivery_Times.csv'
```

2. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python delivery_analysis.py
```

### Expected Output

* 6 professional visualizations for delivery optimization
* Comprehensive business insights with actionable recommendations
* Cleaned dataset ready for further analysis (`optimized_delivery_data.csv`)
* Performance metrics and suggested optimization strategies

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

Each visualization is created to help identify operational bottlenecks and opportunities.

* **Delivery Time Distribution** — Histogram with an average time marker to show the overall spread and outliers.
* **Distance vs Delivery Time** — Scatter plot highlighting correlation between distance and delivery duration.
* **Delivery Performance Segments** — Bar chart grouping deliveries into time categories (e.g., on-time, delayed).
* **Time-of-Day Patterns** — Peak-hour analysis to find busiest delivery windows.
* **Order Value Impact** — Analysis of price vs delivery time to see whether order value affects speed.
* **Delivery Efficiency** — Distribution of km/minute efficiency to identify top/bottom performers.

## 💼 Business Impact

### Quantified Benefits (example outcomes)

* **15%** increase in customer retention with 5-minute faster deliveries.
* **20%** reduction in operational costs through peak-hour optimization.
* **25%** improvement in order frequency with improved on-time rates.

### Strategic Recommendations

* **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust pricing during peak hours to manage demand and incentivize off-peak orders.
* **Micro-fulfillment Centers**: Place small fulfillment hubs in high-density zones to cut travel time.
* **Delivery Time Guarantees**: Offer premium customers guaranteed delivery windows for a fee.
* **Route Optimization**: Implement routing heuristics or integrate route-optimization APIs for distances beyond 5 km.
