## 📊 Project Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project that uncovers optimization opportunities in food delivery operations by analyzing delivery time patterns, distance impact, and operational efficiency metrics. This project provides actionable insights to improve delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Food delivery companies face challenges in maintaining consistent delivery times while managing operational costs. This analysis addresses:
- **Delivery time optimization** across different time slots and distances
- **Operational efficiency** improvements for fleet management
- **Customer experience** enhancement through faster deliveries
- **Cost reduction** through strategic resource allocation

## 📈 Key Insights

### 🚀 Performance Metrics
- **Average Delivery Time**: 35.2 minutes
- **On-Time Rate (<30min)**: 42.8%
- **Optimal Delivery Radius**: 0-2 km (fastest delivery times)
- **Peak Hour Impact**: Dinner hours show 40% longer delivery times

### 💡 Optimization Opportunities
1. **Only 28% of deliveries are "Fast" (<25 minutes)** - Significant improvement potential
2. **Dinner peak hours require 40% more delivery resources** - Fleet optimization needed
3. **Deliveries beyond 5km take 50% longer** - Strategic zone planning recommended

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: [Food Delivery Time Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction)
- **Enhanced Features**: Simulated distance, order value, and time patterns for comprehensive analysis

### Analysis Performed
1. **Delivery Time Distribution Analysis**
2. **Distance vs Delivery Time Correlation**
3. **Time-of-Day Pattern Recognition**
4. **Operational Efficiency Metrics**
5. **Business Impact Quantification**

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
